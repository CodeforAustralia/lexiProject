            <p>After analyzing some problem statements found at Cenitex, we came up with Lexi to help Cenitex improve its capacity to communicate messages to customers in a language that is accessible. Lexi does this by using the most common words in the English language.</p>
            <p>Lexi is a system (web app) that will help Cenitex validate how accessible are most of their comms before sending them to customers.</p>
            <p>What Lexi does is to get a text, analyze it, and validate each word to determine whether that word is either common or uncommon. Then, based on how common each word is, Lexi presents the same text but it highlights each word with a colour tag explaining how common each word is.</p>
            <p>Lexi also indicates how accessible a text is by showing with each message a percentile reading. A message will be green if your use of common words rate higher or equal to 80%. Otherwise, the message will be in red, asking the user to double-check the message. As charts are the best way to show results in a summarized form, Lexi also draws a pie chart with the percentages for both the common and uncommon words.</p>
